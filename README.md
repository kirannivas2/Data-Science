# Class Repository for Kiran Nivas Reddy Sagaturu

This is a repository created for CSE801A course to store the materials, codes, projects and any documents related to the course. This will have all the project files and also the revision history of each project file.

In this course I hope to learn the source code management and methods to maintain the code repository. Also I will learn various analysis and applications using Python that are mentioned below :

+ How to do web scraping, crawling and parallel processing
+ Data analysis packages like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and SciKitLearn
+ Unsupervised and Supervised learning techniques

To access the more information about the course, refer to the [link](https://cse.msu.edu/~cse801a)
